## Introduction  

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast/blob/master/ast.png?raw=true" alt="Illustration of AST." width="300"/></p>

This repository contains Ariadne Matos fork  of the official implementation (in PyTorch) of the **Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)** proposed in the Interspeech 2021 paper [AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01778) (Yuan Gong, Yu-An Chung, James Glass).  

AST is the first **convolution-free, purely** attention-based model for audio classification which supports variable length input and can be applied to various tasks.
 
## Getting Started  

Step 1. Clone or download this repository and set it as the working directory, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```
cd ast/ 
python3 -m venv venvast
source venvast/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
  
Step 2. Test the AST model.

```python
ASTModel(label_dim=527, \
         fstride=10, tstride=10, \
         input_fdim=128, input_tdim=1024, \
         imagenet_pretrain=True, audioset_pretrain=False, \
         model_size='base384')
```  

**Parameters:**\
`label_dim` : The number of classes (default:`527`).\
`fstride`:  The stride of patch spliting on the frequency dimension, for 16\*16 patchs, fstride=16 means no overlap, fstride=10 means overlap of 6 (used in the paper). (default:`10`)\
`tstride`:  The stride of patch spliting on the time dimension, for 16*16 patchs, tstride=16 means no overlap, tstride=10 means overlap of 6 (used in the paper). (default:`10`)\
`input_fdim`: The number of frequency bins of the input spectrogram. (default:`128`)\
`input_tdim`: The number of time frames of the input spectrogram. (default:`1024`, i.e., 10.24s)\
`imagenet_pretrain`: If `True`, use ImageNet pretrained model. (default: `True`, we recommend to set it as `True` for all tasks.)\
`audioset_pretrain`: If`True`,  use full AudioSet And ImageNet pretrained model. Currently only support `base384` model with `fstride=tstride=10`. (default: `False`, we recommend to set it as `True` for all tasks except AudioSet.)\
`model_size`: The model size of AST, should be in `[tiny224, small224, base224, base384]` (default: `base384`).

**Input:** Tensor in shape `[batch_size, temporal_frame_num, frequency_bin_num]`. Note: the input spectrogram should be normalized with dataset mean and std, see [here](https://github.com/aryamtos/ast-brazilian-portuguese/blob/master/src/dataloader.py#L202). \
**Output:** Tensor of raw logits (i.e., without Sigmoid) in shape `[batch_size, label_dim]`.

``` 
cd ast/src
python
```  

```python
import os 
import torch
from models import ASTModel 
# download pretrained model in this directory
os.environ['TORCH_HOME'] = '../pretrained_models'  
# assume each input spectrogram has 100 time frames
input_tdim = 100
# assume the task has 527 classes
label_dim = 527
# create a pseudo input: a batch of 10 spectrogram, each with 100 time frames and 128 frequency bins 
test_input = torch.rand([10, input_tdim, 128]) 
# create an AST model
ast_mdl = ASTModel(label_dim=label_dim, input_tdim=input_tdim, imagenet_pretrain=True)
test_output = ast_mdl(test_input) 
# output should be in shape [10, 527], i.e., 10 samples, each with prediction of 527 classes. 
print(test_output.shape)  
```  

## Use Pretrained Model For Downstream Tasks

You can use the pretrained AST model for your own dataset. There are two ways to doing so.

You can of course only take ``ast/src/models/ast_models.py``, set ``audioset_pretrain=True``, and use it with your training pipeline, the only thing need to take care of is the input normalization, we normalize our input to 0 mean and 0.5 std. To use the pretrained model, you should roughly normalize the input to this range. You can check ``ast/src/get_norm_stats.py`` to see how we compute the stats, or you can try using our AudioSet normalization ``input_spec = (input_spec + 4.26) / (4.57 * 2)``. Using your own training pipeline might be easier if you already have a good one.
Please note that AST needs smaller learning rate (we use 10 times smaller learning rate than our CNN model proposed in the [PSLA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01243)) and converges faster, so please search the learning rate and learning rate scheduler for your task. 

If you want to use our training pipeline, you would need to modify below for your new dataset.
1. You need to create a json file, and a label index for your dataset, see ``ast/egs/audioset/data/`` for an example.
2. In ``/your_dataset/run.sh``, you need to specify the data json file path. You need to set `dataset_mean` and `dataset_std`, if don't know, you can use our AudioSet stats (mean=-4.27, std=4.57); You need to set `audio_length`, which should be the number of frames (e.g., with a 10ms hop, 10-second audio=1000 frames); You need to set the `metrics` in [`acc`,`mAP`] and `loss` in [`CE`,`BCE`]; You need to set the inital learning rate `lr` and learning rate scheduler `lrscheduler_{start,step,decay}`;
You also need to set the SpecAug parameters (``freqm`` and ``timem``, we recommend to mask 48 frequency bins out of 128, and 20% of your time frames), the mixup rate (i.e., how many samples are mixup samples), batch size, etc. While it seems a lot, it is easy if you start with one of our recipe: ``ast/egs/[audioset,esc50,speechcommands]/run.sh]``.

[comment]: <> (3. In ``ast/src/run.py``, line 60-65, you need to add the normalization stats, the input frame length, and if noise augmentation is needed for your dataset. Also take a look at line 101-127 if you have a seperate validation set. For normalization stats, you need to compute the mean and std of your dataset &#40;check ``ast/src/get_norm_stats.py``&#41; or you can try using our AudioSet normalization ``input_spec = &#40;input_spec + 4.26&#41; / &#40;4.57 * 2&#41;``.)

[comment]: <> (4. In ``ast/src/traintest.`` line 55-82, you need to specify the learning rate scheduler, metrics, warmup setting and the optimizer for your task.)

To summarize, to use our training pipeline, you need to creat data files and modify the shell script. You can refer to our ESC-50 and Speechcommands recipes.

Also, please note that we use `16kHz` audios for the pretrained model, so if you want to use the pretrained model, please prepare your data in `16kHz`.
